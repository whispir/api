Built by developers, for developers, Whispir is the place where you can easily build communications into your app â€“ SMS, email, push, voice, chat, web, social, & rich messages.

The Whispir API gives developers the ability to:

* Create, send and retrieve multi-channel messages over 8 different channels
* Invoke scenario based communications for quick, effective and targeted communications
* Publish messages to internal or external web pages, RSS feeds and social networks
* Asynchronously receive all responses to a given message and perform analysis on the data

### Communications Template API

The Whispir.io Template API gives developers the ability to:

* Create rich, cross-channel message templates that can be managed by designers within the Whispir Rich Message Studio.
* Ensure a DRY (don't repeat yourself) pattern within developer code by separating the communication content from code
* Reduce code change by managing content elsewhere

### Event Management API

The Whispir.io API Event Management API provides developers with the tools needed to manage the communication around events that happen:

* When events occur in your organisation, manage them using Whispir.io
* Save different event details; Severity, Priority, Description and Tasks to ensure a path to a seamless resolution
* Automatically inform teams through Whispir's integrated cross-channel messaging, ensuring that you know who has received the message, and more importantly; who hasn't

### Contact Management API

The Whispir.io API provides developers with the ability to manage the recipients of their messages:

* Store contact information in a cloud based highly available and accessible environment
* Use standards based methods to create, update, and delete contact information
* Build forms to allow contacts to self-register and manage their account, with auto-generated email notifications
* Create, update and delete distribution lists that can be accessed for messaging at a later date
